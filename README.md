## Problem to Solve
How can we enable our users to donate food, when their schedule doesn't align with the drop off hours of a food bank?

## Donate. Volunteer. Receive.
Getting food where it's needed.

## Timeframe

Developed in less than 8 working hours, through a collaborative effort between two UX designers: John Grace and Mo Lalehchini, and two developers: Emily Hannan and Kyle Van Bergen.
